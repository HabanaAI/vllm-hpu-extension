## Bucketing Mechanism

Intel Gaudi accelerators perform best when operating on models with fixed tensor shapes. [Intel Gaudi Graph Compiler](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Gaudi_Overview/Intel_Gaudi_Software_Suite.html#graph-compiler-and-runtime)
generates optimized binary code that implements the given model topology on Gaudi. In its default configuration, the produced binary code may be highly dependent on input and output tensor shapes, requiring graph recompilation
when encountering tensors with different shapes within the same topology. While these binaries efficiently utilize Gaudi, the compilation process itself can introduce noticeable overhead in end-to-end execution.
In dynamic inference serving scenarios, minimizing the number of graph compilations and reducing the risk of graph compilation occurring during server runtime is important. Currently, this is achieved by
"bucketing" the model's forward pass across two dimensions: `batch_size` and `sequence_length`.

!!! note
    Bucketing helps significantly reduce the number of required graphs, but does not handle graph compilation or device code generation. These tasks are performed during the warmup and HPUGraph capture phase.

Bucketing ranges are determined with 3 parameters - `min`, `step`, and `max`. They can be set separately for the prompt and decode phase, and batch size and sequence length dimensions. These parameters
can be observed in logs during vLLM startup:

```{.}

```

`min` determines the lowest value of the bucket. `step` determines the interval between buckets, and `max` determines the upper bound of the bucket. Furthermore, the interval between `min` and `step` has special handling - `min` gets multiplied by consecutive powers of two, until the multiplier is less than or equal to `step`. We call this the ramp-up phase, and it is used for handling lower batch sizes with minimum wastage,
while allowing larger padding on larger batch sizes.

**Example with ramp-up**

```{.}
min = 2, step = 32, max = 64
=> ramp_up = (2, 4, 8, 16)
=> stable = (32, 64)
=> buckets = ramp_up + stable => (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64)
```

**Example without ramp-up**

```{.}
min = 128, step = 128, max = 512
=> ramp_up = ()
=> stable = (128, 256, 384, 512)
=> buckets = ramp_up + stable => (128, 256, 384, 512)
```

In the logged scenario, 24 buckets were generated for prompt (prefill) runs, and 48 buckets for decode runs. Each bucket corresponds to a separate optimized device binary for a given model with specified tensor
shapes. Whenever a batch of requests is processed, it is padded across batch and sequence length dimension to the smallest possible bucket.

> [!WARNING]
> If a request exceeds the maximum bucket size in any dimension, it will be processed without padding, and its processing may require a graph compilation, potentially significantly increasing end-to-end latency.
The boundaries of the buckets are user-configurable via environment variables, and upper bucket boundaries can be increased to avoid such scenario.

For example, if a request with 3 sequences, each having a maximum sequence length of 412, is sent to an idle vLLM server, it will be padded and executed as a `(4, 512)` prefill bucket. This is because the `batch_size`
(number of sequences) will be padded to 4 (the nearest batch size dimension higher than 3), and the maximum sequence length will be padded to 512 (the nearest sequence length dimension higher than 412). After the
prefill stage, it will be executed as a `(4, 512)` decode bucket and will remain in this bucket until either the batch dimension changes (e.g., due to a request being completed), in which case it will become
a `(2, 512)` bucket, or the context length increases beyond 512 tokens. It will become a `(4, 640)` bucket at that point.

> [!NOTE]
> Bucketing is transparent to the user – padding in the sequence length dimension is never returned, and padding in the batch dimension does not create new requests.

## Warmup

Warmup is an optional but highly recommended step that occurs before the vLLM server starts listening. It executes a forward pass for each bucket using dummy data. The goal is to pre-compile all graphs
and avoid any graph compilation overhead within bucket boundaries during server runtime. Each warmup step is logged during vLLM startup.

This example uses the same buckets as those in the Bucketing Mechanism section. Each output line corresponds to the execution of a single bucket. When a bucket is executed for the first time, its graph
is compiled and can be reused later, avoiding further graph compilations.

> [!TIP]
> Compiling all the buckets may take some time and can be disabled by setting the `VLLM_SKIP_WARMUP=true` environment variable. Remember that if you do this, you may encounter graph compilations
when executing a given bucket for the first time.

> [!WARNING]
> Disabling warmup is fine for development, but it is highly recommended to enable it in deployment.

## HPU Graph Capture

[HPU Graphs](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/Inference_on_PyTorch/Inference_Using_HPU_Graphs.html) are currently the most performant execution method of vLLM on Intel Gaudi. When HPU Graphs are enabled,
execution graphs will be traced (recorded) ahead of time (after performing warmup), to be later replayed during inference, significantly reducing host overheads. Recording can take large amounts of memory, which
needs to be taken into account when allocating KV cache. Enabling HPU Graphs will impact the number of available KV cache blocks, but vLLM provides user-configurable variables to control memory management.

When HPU Graphs are used, they share the common memory pool ("usable memory") with the KV cache, as determined by the `gpu_memory_utilization` flag (default value is `0.9`). Before the KV cache is allocated,
the model weights are loaded onto the device, and a forward pass of the model is executed on dummy data to estimate memory usage. Only after that, the `gpu_memory_utilization` flag is applied. At its default value,
it marks 90% of the free device memory at that point as usable. Next, the KV cache is allocated, the model is warmed up, and HPU Graphs are captured. The `VLLM_GRAPH_RESERVED_MEM` environment variable defines
the ratio of memory reserved for HPU Graph capture. With its default value (`VLLM_GRAPH_RESERVED_MEM=0.1`), 10% of the usable memory will be reserved for graph capture (referred to as "usable graph memory"),
and the remaining 90% will be used for the KV cache. The environment variable `VLLM_GRAPH_PROMPT_RATIO` determines the ratio of usable graph memory reserved for prefill and decode graphs. A lower value corresponds to less usable graph memory reserved for the prefill stage. For example, setting `VLLM_GRAPH_PROMPT_RATIO=0.2`
reserves 20% of usable graph memory for prefill graphs, while 80% is allocated for decode graphs.

> [!NOTE]
> `gpu_memory_utilization` does not represent the absolute memory usage across the HPU. Instead, it specifies the memory margin after loading the model and running a profile. For example, if a device has 100 GiB of
total memory and 50 GiB of free memory after loading the model weights and executing the profiling run, the default value of `gpu_memory_utilization` will mark 90% of the 50 GiB as usable, leaving 5 GiB as a margin,
regardless of the total device memory.

You can also configure the strategy for capturing HPU graphs separately for the prompt and decode stages. The strategy affects the order in which graphs are captured. Two strategies are implemented:

- `max_bs` - The graph capture queue is sorted in descending order by batch size. Buckets with equal batch sizes are sorted by sequence length in ascending order
  (e.g., `(64, 128)`, `(64, 256)`, `(32, 128)`, `(32, 256)`, `(1, 128)`, `(1,256)`), which is the default strategy for decode.
- `min_tokens` - The graph capture queue is sorted in ascending order by the number of tokens each graph processes (`batch_size*sequence_length`), which is the default strategy for prompt.

When many requests are pending, the vLLM scheduler attempts to fill the maximum batch size for decoding as quickly as possible. Once a request is finished, the decode batch size decreases.
When this happens, vLLM attempts to schedule a prefill iteration for requests in the waiting queue to restore the decode batch size to its previous state. In a fully loaded scenario, the decode
batch size is often at its maximum, making large-batch HPU graphs critical to capture, as indicated by the `max_bs` strategy. Conversely, prefill iterations will typically be executed with very low
batch sizes (1-4), as reflected in the `min_tokens` strategy.

> [!NOTE]
> `VLLM_GRAPH_PROMPT_RATIO` does not set a hard limit on the memory allocated for graphs in each stage (prefill and decode). vLLM first attempts to use the entire usable prefill graph memory
(usable graph memory * VLLM_GRAPH_PROMPT_RATIO) to capture prefilled HPU graphs. It will then attempt to do the same for decode graphs and the usable decode graph memory pool. If one stage is fully
captured and there is unused memory remaining in the usable graph memory pool, vLLM will attempt to capture more graphs for the other stage, until no more HPU Graphs can be captured without exceeding
the reserved memory pool. The behavior of this mechanism is illustrated in the example below.

Each step outlined is logged by the vLLM server, with negative values indicating memory release:
