class WeakSingleton(type):
    """
    A metaclass that creates a WeakSingleton instance. This ensures that only one instance of the class exists.
    WeakSingleton doesn't hold a strong reference to the instance, allowing it to be garbage collected when no longer in use.

    Attributes:
        _instances (Dict[type, object]): A dictionary to store the single instance of each class.
        _instances_argspec (Dict[type, object]): A dictionary to store the argument specifications of each instance.

    Methods:
        __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
            Creates or returns the single instance of the class. If the instance already exists, it checks that the 
            arguments used to create the instance are the same as the ones provided. Raises an assertion error if 
            the arguments differ.
